Gaming isn’t just about playing anymore — it’s about watching, sharing, and interacting. Thanks to platforms like Twitch, YouTube, and Kick, millions of people watch others play games live. Streamers build loyal communities, and many make a living just by being entertaining and consistent online.

This shift has changed how games are developed, marketed, and played. Developers now consider how “streamable” a game is. Titles like Among Us, Fortnite, and Valorant thrived in part because of streaming exposure. For players, streaming isn’t just a hobby — it’s a way to connect with others, build a brand, and even find a career.
