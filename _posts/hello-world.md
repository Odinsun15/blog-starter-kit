Esports — short for electronic sports — has grown from underground competitions in internet cafes to a booming industry with global audiences, professional teams, and multimillion-dollar prize pools. What started as friendly matches between friends has transformed into structured leagues with coaches, analysts, sponsorships, and fans.

Games like League of Legends, Counter-Strike, and Dota 2 headline sold-out arenas while streamers and content creators fuel the hype online. With platforms like Twitch and YouTube Gaming, esports has become accessible to anyone with a passion for games and competition. It’s no longer just a hobby — it’s a career path, a form of entertainment, and a cultural movement.
