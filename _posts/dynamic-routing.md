Computer gaming offers many genres to suit different players. First-person shooters (FPS) are fast-paced and action-packed. Role-playing games (RPGs) immerse you in rich storylines and character development. Strategy games test your thinking and planning skills.

Simulation and sandbox games let players be creative or experience realistic scenarios. From Minecraft to Civilization, the gaming world has something for everyone.
