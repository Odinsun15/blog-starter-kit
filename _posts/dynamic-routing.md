Computer gaming covers a wide range of genres designed for every type of player. First-person shooters (FPS) are known for their speed and precision, while role-playing games (RPGs) allow players to explore immersive worlds through story-driven quests. Strategy games challenge players to think critically, plan ahead, and manage resources efficiently.

Simulation games like The Sims and flight simulators mimic real-life experiences, offering creative and relaxing gameplay. Meanwhile, sandbox games like Minecraft give players the freedom to build, explore, and experiment in open-ended environments. With so many options, gaming continues to grow as a diverse and engaging form of entertainment.
