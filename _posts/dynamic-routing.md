Computer gaming offers a wide variety of genres to match every kind of player. Some of the most popular include first-person shooters (FPS), which focus on fast reflexes and accuracy; role-playing games (RPGs), where players take on character-driven adventures; and strategy games, which test tactical thinking and planning skills.

Other major genres include simulation games like The Sims or Flight Simulator, which mimic real-world experiences, and sandbox games such as Minecraft, where creativity and exploration are the main focus. Each genre appeals to different interests, making gaming one of the most diverse forms of entertainment today.
